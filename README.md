# chip8-emulator
chip8 emulator, written in C++


# How to use:
Clone the repository and execute the chip8. If you use Windows or Mac built it with "g++ -g chip8.cpp -o chip8 -lSDL2"
To built it you need the libary "SDL2".

To run the emulator run it over the console with a 2nd arg which stands for the rom to load (only roms in the same folder).
e.g "./chip8 PONG"
